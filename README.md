# Hi, I'm Aparna RVM ðŸ‘‹

I am a Cognitive Scientist, AI Researcher, and Neuro-AI Entrepreneur exploring the intersection of the human mind and intelligent machines.

My mission is to build technologies that reimagine our relationship with machines, not as tools, but as partners in enhancing human potential. This journey is deeply personal. It began when my mother's stroke revealed a critical gap in our healthcare systemâ€”we could heal the body, but we struggled to heal the mind.

That experience ignited my life's work: to decode the complexities of the brain and build interfaces that can restore and enhance our most vital cognitive functions. I am the founder of NeuMe Neurotech, a venture dedicated to making this vision a reality.

## My Vision & Research

With a background in cognitive science, I am focused on the next generation of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and wearable technologies. My primary interest lies in cognitive enhancementâ€”how we can design and build assistive systems to help people improve their attention, memory, learning, and decision-making capabilities.

My research explores fundamental questions:

How can we create truly symbiotic brain-machine interfaces?

What does it mean to build AI that doesn't just automate tasks, but actively helps us think and heal better?

How can we make these powerful technologies accessible and beneficial for all, especially in the realm of human welfare and assistive tech?
